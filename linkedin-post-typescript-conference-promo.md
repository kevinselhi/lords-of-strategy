# LinkedIn Post: Promoting TypeScript AI Conference Article

Last week at the TypeScript AI Conference in San Francisco, I watched a genuine AI infrastructure ecosystem form in real time.

Not the usual conference theater—this was practitioners who've shipped agents to production comparing notes on what actually breaks at scale. The operational realities don't make it into most AI discourse, but they're what separates viable businesses from expensive experiments.

Three observations that keep coming back to me:

First, observability isn't a post-deployment concern for AI systems—it's existential from day one. When you're orchestrating hundreds of LLM calls in agent workflows, you lose visibility into failure modes almost immediately without proper instrumentation.

Second, developer experience is becoming a primary competitive moat in AI tooling, not a secondary consideration. The tools that win will be the ones that respect developers' time and mental models.

Third, TypeScript is emerging as the default runtime not just because developers like it, but because type safety matters exponentially more when you're mixing non-deterministic LLM outputs with deterministic business logic.

We're past the "can we build this?" phase and deep into "how do we operate this economically at scale?" The infrastructure being built now will define the next several years of AI development.

I wrote up my full observations from the conference, including conversations with folks from OpenAI, Replit, Arize, Langfuse, Vapi, and builders from across the ecosystem. Link in comments.
